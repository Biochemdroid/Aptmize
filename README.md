# Aptmize
## Python script to optimize DNA/RNA sequences based on thermodynamic stability. Uses Quickfold software from the UNAFold Web Server

Note: This program did not have any part in designing the quickfold program. It is simply a web scraping, organizational, and ranking tool that allows the user to input mass amounts of sequences to determine the most probable aptamer designs.
